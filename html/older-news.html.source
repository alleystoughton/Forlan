<h1>The Forlan Project (Version #VERSION#): Older News</h1>

<hr/>

<h2>Older News</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Version 4.10</dt>
<dd>
Generalized <kbd>eliminateVariable</kbd> to work when variable to be
elminated has multiple productions (without self-recursion).
Continuing revision of book.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.9</dt>
<dd>
Added two functions for hand-simplification of grammars to 
<kbd>Gram</kbd> module (see the manual and book for descriptions
of <kbd>eliminateVariable</kbd> and <kbd>restart</kbd>). Continuing
revision of book.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.8</dt>
<dd>
Improved documentation of local and global regular expression
simplification.  Continuing revision of book.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.7</dt>
<dd>
Added functions to <kbd>StrSet</kbd> for prefix, suffix and substring
closure. Minor documentation changes. Starting revision of book.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.6</dt>
<dd>
Bringing Forlan up-to-date with most recent SML/NJ compiler (110.82).
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.5</dt>
<dd>
This release includes Version 2.1 of JForlan, which fixes a minor bug
relating to regular expression tree error checking and includes the
changes needed to make JForlan build using Apache Ant.</dd>

<dt>Version 4.4</dt>
<dd>
This release features a new draft (September 2012) of the textbook, as
well as some minor changes and additions to the Forlan toolset and
manual. The <kbd>RFA</kbd> module of the toolset now exports functions
for standardizing an RFA and for converting an RFA to a regular
expression.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.3</dt>
<dd>
This release features a new draft (August 2012) of the textbook, as
well as some relatively minor changes and additions to the Forlan
toolset and manual.  Most significantly, the textbook now includes a
draft of Chapter 5, which uses a functional programming language to
study the recursive and recursively enumerable languages.  I believe
that the toolset is now in close to final form.  The textbook should
be usable, but still needs substantial work.
</dd>

<dt>Version 4.2</dt>
<dd>
This release features changes to Forlan, JForlan, the Forlan manual,
and the draft textbook.  Major changes have been made to Forlan's
simplification algorithms for regular expressions, small changes have
been made to the simplification algorithms for finite automata and
grammars, and the parsing algorithm for context-free grammars has been
improved.  The new release (Version 2.0) of JForlan contains numerous
bug fixes and changes of functionality.  Error checking is now always
turned on, and if there are no errors, the Forlan syntax of the
current project's automaton or tree is displayed.  Projects now have a
committable boolean attribute, which is true exactly when the project
originated from Forlan.  Only committable projects may be committed
back to Forlan. There is now a full draft of the Forlan manual.
The draft textbook is now consistent with the toolset, and
contains all the material that was only in the lecture slides in
Version 4.1.  Those lecture slides are no longer part of the Forlan
release.</dd>

<dt>Version 4.1</dt>
<dd>This release features small changes to the Forlan toolset's
lexical analyzer.</dd>

<dt>Version 4.0</dt>
<dd>This release features a completely redesigned and redeveloped
version of JForlan (Version 1.0), the graphical editor for Forlan
automata and trees.</dd>
