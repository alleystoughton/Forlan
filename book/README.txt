This directory contains the LaTeX source for the above book.  The root

----------------------------- Modifying the Book -----------------------------

The BASE.eepic files were generated using xfig from the
BASE.fig files.  Xfig should be started up with the

  -latexfonts -specialtext -exportLanguage eepic

options.

The chap-N.M-forlanL.tex Forlan transcripts were generated from the
chap-N.M-forlanL files, using the program smlnjtrans.  See

  http://alleystoughton.us/smlnjtrans/

This process was automated by the chap-N.M-transcripts shell
scripts.  To run these scripts, you must have both smlnjtrans
and forlan on your search path.  The script book-transcripts
runs all of the transcripts.

The script cleanup can be used to delete all of the files generated by
latex, bibtex, etc.

Run make-and-install-book to generate the book and install in the
HTML directory.
