Formal Language Theory: Integrating Experimentation with Proof
=============================================================================

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the above book.  The root
file is `book.tex`.

Run

```
  latexmk -pdfps book.tex
```

to generate the PDF version of the book: book.pdf.  A copy of
[`latexmk`](http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk/) is in
this directory.

Modifying the Book
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `BASE.eepic` files were generated using `xfig` from the
`BASE.fig` files.  Xfig should be started up with the

```
  -latexfonts -specialtext -exportLanguage eepic
```

options.

The `chap-N.M-forlanL.tex` Forlan transcripts were generated from the
`chap-N.M-forlanL` files, using the program
[`smlnjtrans`](http://alleystoughton.us/smlnjtrans/).

This process was automated by the `chap-N.M-transcripts` shell
scripts.  To run these scripts, you must have both smlnjtrans and
forlan on your search path.  The script
[`book-transcripts`](book-transcripts) runs all of the transcripts.

The script [`cleanup`](cleanup) can be used to delete all of the files
generated by `latex`, `bibtex`, etc.

Run make-and-install-book to generate the book and install in the
`HTML` directory.
