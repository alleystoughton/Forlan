\chapter{Regular Languages}
\label{RegularLanguages}

In this chapter, we study our most restrictive set of languages, the
regular languages.  We begin by introducing regular expressions, and
saying that a language is regular iff it is generated by a regular
expression. We study regular expression equivalance, look at how
regular expressions can be synthesized and proved correct, and study
several algorithms for regular expression simplification.

We go on to study five kinds of finite automata, culminating in finite
automata whose transitions are labeled by regular expressions.  We
introduce methods for synthesizing and proving the correctness of
finite automata, and study numerous algorithms for processing and
converting between regular expressions and finite automata.  Because
of these conversions, the set of languages accepted by the finite
automata is exactly the regular languages.  The chapter concludes by
considering the application of regular expressions and finite automata
to searching in text files, lexical analysis, and the design of
finite state systems.
