In this section, we give simple algorithms for converting regular
expressions and finite automata to grammars.  Since we have algorithms
for converting between regular expressions and finite automata, it is
tempting to only define one of these algorithms.  But better results
can be obtained by defining direct conversions.

\subsection{Converting Regular Expressions to Grammars}

Regular expressions are converted to grammars using a recursive
algorithm that makes use of some of the operations on grammars that
were defined in Section~\ref{ClosurePropertiesOfContextFreeLanguages}.
The structure of the algorithm is very similar to the structure of our
algorithm for converting regular expressions to finite automata (see
Section~\ref{ClosurePropertiesOfRegularLanguages}).  This
gives us a function $\regToGram\in\Reg\fun\Gram$.
\index{grammar!regToGram@$\regToGram$}%
\index{regular expression!regToGram@$\regToGram$}%

The algorithm is implemented in Forlan by the function
\begin{verbatim}
val fromReg : reg -> gram
\end{verbatim}
\index{Gram@\texttt{Gram}!fromReg@\texttt{fromReg}}%
of the \texttt{Gram} module.  It's available in the top-level
environment with the name \texttt{regToGram}.
\index{grammar!regToGram@\texttt{regToGram}}%
\index{regular expression!regToGram@\texttt{regToGram}}%

Here is how we can convert the regular expression $\mathsf{01 +
10(11)^*}$ to a grammar using Forlan:
\input{chap-4.8-forlan1}

\subsection{Converting Finite Automata to Grammars}

Suppose $M$ is an FA. We define a function/algorithm $\faToGram\in
\index{grammar!faToGram@\texttt{faToGram}}%
\index{finite automaton!faToGram@\texttt{faToGram}}%
\FA\fun\Gram$ by, for all FAs $M$, $\faToGram\,M$ is the grammar
$G$ defined below. If $Q_M\cap\alphabet\,M=\emptyset$, then $G$ is
defined by
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q_G = Q_M$;

\item $s_G = s_M$;

\item $P_G = \setof{q\fun xr}{q,x\fun r\in T_M} \cup
  \setof{q\fun\%}{q\in A_M}$.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, we first rename the states of $M$ using a uniform
number of $\langle$ and $\rangle$ pairs, so as to avoid conflicts
with the elements of $M$'s alphabet.

For example, suppose $M$ is the DFA
\begin{center}
  \input{chap-4.8-fig1.eepic}
\end{center}
Our algorithm converts $M$ into the grammar
\begin{align*}
  \Asf &\fun \% \mid \mathsf{0B} \mid \mathsf{1A} , \\
  \Bsf &\fun \mathsf{0A} \mid \mathsf{1B} .
\end{align*}

Consider, e.g., the valid labeled path for $M$
\begin{gather*}
\Asf\lparr{\onesf}\Asf\lparr{\zerosf}\Bsf\lparr{\zerosf}\Asf ,
\end{gather*}
which explains why $\mathsf{100}\in L(M)$.  It corresponds to the
valid parse tree for $G$
\begin{center}
\input{chap-4.8-fig2.eepic}
\end{center}
which explains why $\mathsf{100}\in L(G)$.

If we have converted an FA $M$ to a grammar $G$, we can prove
$L(M)\sub L(G)$ by induction on the lengths of labeled paths,
and we can prove $L(G)\sub L(M)$ by induction on parse trees.
Thus we have $L(G) = L(M)$.

\begin{exercise}
State and prove a pair of lemmas that can be used to prove
the inclusions $L(M)\sub L(G)$ and $L(G)\sub L(M)$.
\end{exercise}

The Forlan module \texttt{Gram} contains the function
\begin{verbatim}
val fromFA : fa -> gram
\end{verbatim}
which implements our algorithm for converting finite automata to
grammars.  It's available in the top-level environment with the name
\texttt{faToGram}.

Suppose \texttt{fa} of type \texttt{fa} is bound to $M$.  Here is how
we can convert $M$ to a grammar using Forlan:
\input{chap-4.8-forlan3}

\subsection{Consequences of Conversion Functions}

Because of the existence of our conversion functions, we have that
every regular language is a context-free language.
On the other hand, the language $\setof{\zerosf^n\onesf^n}{n\in\nats}$
is context-free, because of the grammar
\begin{gather*}
  \Asf\fun\%\mid\zerosf\Asf\onesf ,
\end{gather*}
but is not regular, as we proved in
Section~\ref{ThePumpingLemmaForRegularLanguages}.

Summarizing, we have:
\index{regular language!proper subset of context-free languages}%
\index{context-free language!proper superset of regular languages}%

\begin{theorem}
The regular languages are a proper subset of the context-free
languages: $\RegLan\subsetneq\CFLan$.
\end{theorem}
