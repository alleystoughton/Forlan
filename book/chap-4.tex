\chapter{Context-free Languages}
\label{ContextFreeLanguages}

In this chapter, we study context-free grammars and languages.
Context-free grammars are used to describe the syntax of programming
languages, i.e., to specify parsers of programming languages.

A language is called context-free iff it is generated by a
context-free grammar.  It will turn out that the set of all
context-free languages is a proper superset of the set of all regular
\index{regular language}%
languages.  On the other hand, the context-free languages have weaker
closure properties than the regular languages, and we won't be able to
give algorithms for checking grammar equivalence or minimizing the
size of grammars.
