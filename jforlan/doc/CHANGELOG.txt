JForlan Change Log

Version 2.0 (Alley Stoughton, April 2011)

Another major revision, with numerous bug fixes, changes of
functionality, and code rewriting for clarity.

Error checking is now always done, and the result always displayed;
if there are no errors, the Forlan syntax of the current
project's automaton or tree is displayed instead.

Projects now have a committable boolean field, which is true iff
the project originated from Forlan.  Only committable projects
may be committed back to Forlan.  But now, when invoked from
Forlan, projects may be created and opened.

Version 1.1 (Alley Stoughton, March 2011)

Minor bug fixes

Version 1.0 (Kenton Born, December 2009)

- Modified FA/RFA states to expand based on the width of the label

- Rewrote FA/RFA transition drawing to allow for more flexible line placement
and to allow the transition dot to be moved back and forth across the line.

- Added a label placement algorithm that finds the nearest open
position to the transition dot based on an archimedean spiral.

- Added real-time error checking to FA/RFA diagrams

- Improved the error checking for FA/RFA and trees.

- Regular expression labels and nodes are now simplified when possible

- Files saved to Forlan syntax are now formatted cleanly and minimally.

- Drawing canvases for finite automata and trees were reworked to share
a common look and feel.

- Added new layout algorithm to tree diagrams.

- Buttons on the primary window were reformatted and modified. New icon
pictures were created for several buttons.

- Added "About" Dialog

- Added MAC look and feel when the program is invoked from a MAC

- Added "snap to grid" functionality for all drawing canvases.

- Created new open/create dialogs, and added "automatic naming" process.

- Modified Forlan syntax files to work off of the ".txt" extension

- Modified "save project as image" functionality to account for portions of 
the diagram outside the visible window.
