The architecture of the program revolves around the MainFrame (primary
window) and the Controller. Any operations invoked through this window
are handled by the controller. The controller maintains an interface
to Forlan that handles much of the validity checking as well as the
formatting when saving a diagram to Forlan snytax.

There are two types of panels that are used for the drawing canvas,
FAProjects and TreeProjects (depending on whether the user is
currently working on an FA, RFA, parse tree, regular expression tree,
or program tree). The creation and management of these panels is
handled by the controller.

A PNG image of the system architecture can be found under the name
"class_diagram.png". This gives an overview of the structure of the
system.
