    JForlan: a Java Graphical Editor for Forlan Automata and Trees

JForlan is an application for creating and editing Forlan automata and
trees.  More specifically, it handles finite automata, regular
expression finite automata, parse trees, regular expression trees, and
program trees.

JForlan automatically maintains the connections between the components of
automata and trees as those components are repositioned using the mouse. It also
handles the conversion of diagrams from and to Forlan's concrete syntax.

JForlan can be invoked directly (as a standalone application) or from Forlan.
